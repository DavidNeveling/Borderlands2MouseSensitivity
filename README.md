# Borderlands2MouseSensitivity
I found the script online, but had some weird issues since I was running on the bash shell on windows 10. This is an updated python script for anyone doing a similar thing.

# Usage
Use a hex editor (I used HxD, but others should work) to find the offset/position of your mouse sensitivity. Change it a couple times in game just so you know for sure. Then put this file in the same folder as profile.bin (should be in your Documents in your main drive Documents/My Games/Borderlands2/WillowGame/SaveData/"number"/). Then run in the command line -> python sensscript.py "new sensitivity" (some people haven't had to type "python" before, but I altered the script before I knew anything about python so I can't say why for sure).
